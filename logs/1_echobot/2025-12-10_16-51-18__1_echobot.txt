ECHOBOT-03
This is my fourth conversation with Echobot (Terminal) testing
Echobot's convo generation in light of new and relocated file_log.flush
statements. 

Stumbled on error where Echobot can't handle multiline input because of 
Terminal, so added new read_user_msg function to access new multiline
paste mode.
