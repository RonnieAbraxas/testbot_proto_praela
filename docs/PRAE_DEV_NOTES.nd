# PRAE Dev Notes – TestBot Core

Series: PRAE-0000+

## PRAE-0000 – Initial CLI Loop & History Logging
**Date:** 2025-12-07  
**Scope:** Minimal TestBot.py (CLI loop, fake brain, in-memory history, history.txt dump on exit)

- Created `testbot.py` with:
  - conversation loop (`while True`)
  - `generate_reply(user_message)` placeholder
  - in-memory `history` as list of (user, bot) tuples
  - `quit` / `exit` commands
- On quit:
  - write `history` to `history.txt` using `with open(..., "a")`
- This is the first canonical Praela code file.

======================
## PRAE-0001 – Modular Architecture & Clean Entry Point
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Scope:** Module split (CLI, Brain, App Package), proper entry point, improved history handling

- Created `app/` package with:
  - `cli.py` – user loop (`run_cli()`), exit handling, `write_history()` function
  - `brain.py` – `ConversationTurn` and `ConversationHistory` type aliases, placeholder `generate_reply(...)`
  - `__init__.py` – package metadata and re-export for convenience

- Updated `testbot.py` to act as the clean application entry point (Pattern B architecture):
  - imports and calls `run_cli()` inside `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  - ensures CLI only launches when explicitly run, not on import

- Implemented improved history behavior:
  - writes conversation to a separate file (e.g. `history2.txt`)
  - cleaned newline formatting
  - uses `Path()` from `pathlib` for OS-safe file handling

- Verified CLI loop runs correctly, records user/bot turns, and exits gracefully.

**Notes / Insights**
- Clarified Python import behavior and `__name__ == "__main__"` entry guard.
- Type hints now understood as structural contracts rather than enforcement.
- Brain and CLI modules now cleanly separated for future LLM integration.
- TestBot now resembles a real application skeleton rather than a monolithic script.

## Next up
- PRAE-0002: Real-time timestamped logging, auto-naming conversation files  
- PRAE-0003: Integrate first real LLM (Gemma 2 Instruct, Mistral, or candidate model) into `brain.py`  
- PRAE-0004: Add contextual prompt-building & memory hooks for Proto-Praela



======================
## PRAE-0002 – Real-Time Timestamped Logging & Auto-Named Conversation Files
**Date:** 2025-12-09  
**Scope:** Full logging system overhaul: timestamps, per-phase folders, auto-named files

### Changes Implemented
- Added `logs/` root directory with subfolders per phase (e.g., `logs/echobot/`)
- Implemented timestamp-based file naming via:
  - `make_log_file_path(phase)`
  - ISO-style datetime strings for ordering and consistency
- Upgraded `run_cli()` to:
  - create a fresh log file at conversation start
  - write entries *immediately* with `flush()` to prevent data loss
  - format each turn as:

        2025-12-09T12:48:03
        User: Hello TestBot!

        2025-12-09T12:48:03
        Bot:  I heard you say: Hello TestBot!

- Added a global `timestamp()` helper for consistent formatting
- All log writing now happens **in the open file context**, instead of huge end-of-convo dumps

### Notes / Insights
- `flush()` ensures no memory or progress is ever lost — essential for ASE-grade logging.
- `Path` objects from `pathlib` make file generation safer across OSes.
- Conversation storage is now scalable, audit-friendly, and ready for model auditions.
