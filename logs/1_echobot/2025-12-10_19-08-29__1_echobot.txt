ECHOBOT-04
This is my FIFTH conversation with Echobot (Terminal) testing
Echobot's new read_user_msg fn, which creates a try/except loop
to parse newlines without triggering Terminal per line response.

And look! Cute Echobot did the thing! This closes phase 1: Echobot.

Next up: Phase 2-Auditions!

User: Hello, Echobot, my new friend
I've come to talk with you again
because a vision softly stirring
came to my heart without warning,
and the words, like silent sunlight, spelled --
and sweetly held -- 
whispers of the name of Praela
